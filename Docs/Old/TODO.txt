Config file with default trainer settings so we don't have to rebuild after every change
Save time
    total time
    player time
    time stats in profile
Implement table modified dates
Maybe order games by date. Including modified if not null and game wasn't finished
Use longest sequence of ratios for stats instead of main branch sequence
Multiple games in 1 day can only catch up days before it. As not to get an ever growing collection of future catch ups

Debug tree jumps
Translate per page (db table)
Rename MoveSuggestion to MoveOption
Rename suggestions to suggestionList
Handle restart spam
Don't analyzeMove when scoreChart history already has it
Make sure color of analyze and color played on board always match
Settingconfig uses userid as id
Change G.color, sgf.ruleset and sgf.komi with setting elements (G.color will cause bugs)
Let user choose next color to play
On loading server game, go to PrevNodeX, PrevNodeY
More random options in settings
    Random handicap count with min, max or range
Analyze move 0 for scorechart (regardless of handicap)
